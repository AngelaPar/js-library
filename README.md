# Library (Firebase + LocalStorage)

This was one of the first projects I built at 14, while I was still deciding if software engineering was the path for me. Iâ€™m keeping it here mainly for documentationâ€”a snapshot of my early exploration.

Projects like this made me realize just how much I enjoy piecing things together to finish a project, especially the challenge of breaking it down into manageable parts.

Based on The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library).
